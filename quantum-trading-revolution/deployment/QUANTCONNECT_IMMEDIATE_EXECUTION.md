## üìä CRITICAL VARIANCE ANALYSIS - HOUR 2

### **IMMEDIATE TOLERANCE CALCULATION - ZERO TOLERANCE >5%**

#### **Variance Calculation Protocol**
```python
# CALCULATE VARIANCE FOR EACH METRIC:

EXPECTED VALUES (From Local Optimization):
Expected_Return = 24.07%
Expected_Sharpe = 0.801  
Expected_Drawdown = 10.34%
Expected_Alpha = 21.42%

TOLERANCE BANDS (¬±5% MAX):
Return_Min = 22.87%    Return_Max = 25.27%
Sharpe_Min = 0.761     Sharpe_Max = 0.841
Drawdown_Min = 9.82%   Drawdown_Max = 10.86%  
Alpha_Min = 20.35%     Alpha_Max = 22.49%

ACTUAL VALUES (From QuantConnect):
Actual_Return = ____.__%
Actual_Sharpe = _.___
Actual_Drawdown = ____.__%
Actual_Alpha = ____.__%

VARIANCE CALCULATIONS:
Return_Variance = |Actual_Return - 24.07| / 24.07 * 100 = ____.__%
Sharpe_Variance = |Actual_Sharpe - 0.801| / 0.801 * 100 = ____.__%  
Drawdown_Variance = |Actual_Drawdown - 10.34| / 10.34 * 100 = ____.__%
Alpha_Variance = |Actual_Alpha - 21.42| / 21.42 * 100 = ____.__%
```

#### **PASS/FAIL DETERMINATION - CRITICAL DECISION**
```
VALIDATION RESULTS:

Total Return:
‚òê PASS (Variance ‚â§5.0%: ____._%)  
‚òê FAIL (Variance >5.0%: ____._%) ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED

Sharpe Ratio:  
‚òê PASS (Variance ‚â§5.0%: ____._%)
‚òê FAIL (Variance >5.0%: ____._%) ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED

Max Drawdown:
‚òê PASS (Variance ‚â§5.0%: ____._%)  
‚òê FAIL (Variance >5.0%: ____._%) ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED

Alpha vs SPY:
‚òê PASS (Variance ‚â§5.0%: ____._%)
‚òê FAIL (Variance >5.0%: ____._%) ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED

Trade Count:
‚òê PASS (Count: ___ within 2-4 range)
‚òê FAIL (Count: ___ outside 2-4 range) ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED

OVERALL VALIDATION STATUS:
‚òê ‚úÖ ALL PASS ‚Üí PROCEED TO PAPER TRADING DEPLOYMENT  
‚òê üö® ANY FAIL ‚Üí IMMEDIATE CEO ESCALATION REQUIRED

IF ANY FAIL: STOP ALL ACTIVITIES, ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY
