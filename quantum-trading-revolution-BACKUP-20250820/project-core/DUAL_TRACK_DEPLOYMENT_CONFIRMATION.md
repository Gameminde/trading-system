## ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION ROADMAP

### **âœ… SENTIMENT ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY**

**Current Baseline:**
- MA Crossover Sharpe ratio: 0.801
- Pure technical signal confidence system
- Limited to price action analysis

**Enhancement Plan:**
```python
# Sentiment-Enhanced Confidence Scoring
technical_confidence = 0.7  # Base MA crossover confidence
sentiment_score = 0.6       # Bullish sentiment (0.6/1.0)  
sentiment_confidence = 0.8  # High confidence in sentiment

# Enhanced signal calculation  
enhanced_confidence = (
    technical_confidence * 0.7 +           # 70% technical weight
    sentiment_score * sentiment_confidence * 0.3  # 30% sentiment weight
)
# Result: 0.634 (base) + 0.144 (sentiment boost) = 0.778 enhanced
```

**Target Performance Enhancement:**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.801 â†’ 1.5+ (87% improvement target)
- **Signal Quality:** 20-30% confidence boost via sentiment
- **Risk Management:** Position sizing adjustment based on sentiment strength
- **Market Regime:** Better performance in sentiment-driven moves
