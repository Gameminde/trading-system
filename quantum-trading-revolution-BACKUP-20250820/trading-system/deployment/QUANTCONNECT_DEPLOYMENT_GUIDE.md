## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK DISCLAIMERS

### Algorithm Limitations
- **Market Regime Dependency:** Strategy optimized for 2022-2024 market conditions
- **Single Asset Focus:** Primary validation on SPY; other assets show mixed results
- **Low Frequency Trading:** 2-4 trades per year may miss shorter-term opportunities
- **Trend Following Nature:** May underperform in range-bound markets

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing:** Limited to 95% of capital to maintain liquidity
- **Stop Losses:** 15% maximum loss per position
- **Drawdown Monitoring:** Alert if exceeds 12% (above backtested maximum)
- **Performance Degradation:** Review strategy if Sharpe falls below 0.5

### Monitoring Requirements
- **Daily Performance Review:** Track against backtested expectations
- **Weekly Risk Assessment:** Monitor drawdown and position concentration
- **Monthly Strategy Review:** Assess signal quality and market regime changes
- **Quarterly Optimization:** Consider parameter adjustments if performance degrades
