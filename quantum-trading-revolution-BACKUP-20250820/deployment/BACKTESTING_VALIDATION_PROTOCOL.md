   - Asset: SPY ✅
   
3. Click "BACKTEST" button
4. Monitor execution - should complete in 2-3 minutes
5. Record exact start time: _____ and completion time: _____

WATCH FOR: Any compilation errors, data issues, or execution failures
```

#### **Action 1.2: Document Raw Results**
```
RECORD EXACTLY AS SHOWN:

TIMESTAMP: _____ (Record exact time of results)
```

### **STEP 2: CRITICAL VARIANCE ANALYSIS (45 MINUTES)**

#### **Variance Calculation - ZERO TOLERANCE >5%**
```python
# CRITICAL CALCULATIONS - DO MANUALLY:

Expected Results:
- Total Return: 24.07%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.801
- Max Drawdown: 10.34%
- Alpha: +21.42%

Tolerance Bands (±5%):
- Total Return: 22.87% to 25.27%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.761 to 0.841
- Max Drawdown: 9.82% to 10.86%
- Alpha: +20.35% to +22.49%

ACTUAL VARIANCE CALCULATION:
Variance = (Actual - Expected) / Expected * 100

Total Return Variance: ____%
Sharpe Ratio Variance: ____%  
Max Drawdown Variance: ____%
Alpha Variance: ____%

🚨 ESCALATION TRIGGER: ANY variance >5.0%
```

#### **Pass/Fail Assessment**
```
VALIDATION RESULTS:
☐ Total Return: PASS/FAIL (Variance: ___%)
☐ Sharpe Ratio: PASS/FAIL (Variance: ___%)
☐ Max Drawdown: PASS/FAIL (Variance: ___%)
☐ Alpha: PASS/FAIL (Variance: ___%)
☐ Trade Count: PASS/FAIL (Count: _____)

OVERALL STATUS: 
☐ ALL PASS → PROCEED TO PAPER TRADING
☐ ANY FAIL → IMMEDIATE ESCALATION REQUIRED

IF ANY FAIL: STOP ALL ACTIVITY, ESCALATE TO CEO IMMEDIATELY
```

---

### **STEP 3: TRADE LOG DETAILED ANALYSIS (45 MINUTES)**

#### **Trade-by-Trade Verification**
```
EXPECTED TRADE PATTERN (From Local Optimization):
Trade 1: BUY on signal date _____ at price ~$_____
Trade 2: SELL on signal date _____ at price ~$_____
Trade 3: (If applicable) BUY/SELL details
Trade 4: (If applicable) BUY/SELL details

ACTUAL QUANTCONNECT TRADES:
Trade 1: _____ on _____ at price $_____
Trade 2: _____ on _____ at price $_____
Trade 3: _____ on _____ at price $_____
Trade 4: _____ on _____ at price $_____

VALIDATION CHECKS:
☐ Trade timing matches signal logic (MA crossovers at 0.5% threshold)
☐ Position sizes calculated correctly (95% max investment)
☐ Risk management triggered appropriately (15% stop, 25% take profit)
☐ Transaction costs applied correctly (0.1% per trade)
☐ No unexpected trades or missed signals

TRADE LOG STATUS: PASS/FAIL
```

#### **Signal Logic Verification**
```
CRITICAL ALGORITHM LOGIC CHECKS:
☐ Fast MA (5-day) calculated correctly
☐ Slow MA (35-day) calculated correctly  
☐ Separation threshold (0.5%) applied properly
☐ Crossover detection logic functional
☐ Confidence scoring working as designed

POSITION MANAGEMENT CHECKS:
☐ Maximum position size (95%) respected
☐ Cash management appropriate
☐ Order execution prices realistic
☐ Slippage and costs included

RISK MANAGEMENT CHECKS:
☐ Stop loss orders placed correctly
☐ Take profit levels set appropriately
☐ Maximum drawdown monitoring active
☐ Position sizing based on confidence

ALGORITHM LOGIC STATUS: PASS/FAIL
```

## 🚨 ESCALATION PROCEDURES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **IF ANY VARIANCE >5% DETECTED**

#### **IMMEDIATE ESCALATION STEPS**
```
1. STOP ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES IMMEDIATELY
2. DOCUMENT EXACT VARIANCE WITH SCREENSHOTS
3. RECORD TIMESTAMP AND DETAILED RESULTS
4. PREPARE ESCALATION REPORT (Template Below)
5. NOTIFY CEO IMMEDIATELY - NO DELAYS

DO NOT PROCEED TO PAPER TRADING
DO NOT CONTINUE OTHER TRACKS
FOCUS 100% ON ISSUE RESOLUTION
```

#### **ESCALATION REPORT TEMPLATE**
```
