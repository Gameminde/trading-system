CRITICAL: Use exact naming convention for tracking
```

### **Action 2.2: Copy Complete Algorithm Code**
```
Source File: quantum-trading-revolution/src/trading/algorithms/quantconnect_ma_crossover.py
Total Lines: 435 lines
Method: Copy-paste ENTIRE file content

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- ✅ All imports present
- ✅ QuantConnectMAStrategy class complete  
- ✅ QuantumTradingMAAlgorithm class complete
- ✅ All methods and functions included
- ✅ Comments and documentation preserved

DO NOT EDIT - Use code exactly as optimized
```

### **Action 2.3: Parameter Verification - CRITICAL**
```python
# VERIFY THESE EXACT OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS:
self.strategy = QuantConnectMAStrategy(
    fast_period=5,          # ✅ Must be 5 (optimized from 10)
    slow_period=35,         # ✅ Must be 35 (optimized from 30)  
    threshold=0.005         # ✅ Must be 0.005 (0.5% optimized from 1%)
)

# VERIFY CAPITAL AND DATES:
self.SetStartDate(2022, 1, 1)      # ✅ January 1, 2022
self.SetEndDate(2023, 12, 31)      # ✅ December 31, 2023
self.SetCash(100000)               # ✅ $100,000 capital

# VERIFY EXPECTED PERFORMANCE COMMENTS:
# Expected Performance: 24.07% return, 0.801 Sharpe, 10.34% max drawdown
```

### **Action 2.4: Compilation Test**
```
Compilation Steps:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+B (or click Compile button)
2. Wait for compilation (should take 10-30 seconds)
3. Check for any errors in console

EXPECTED RESULT: "Compilation successful" message
ERROR HANDLING: Any compilation errors = IMMEDIATE ESCALATION

Common Issues:
- Missing imports (all should be QuantConnect standard)
- Indentation errors (Python specific)
- Syntax issues (should not occur with provided code)
```

## ⚡ STEP 3: IMMEDIATE VALIDATION (15 MINUTES) - VERIFY SETTINGS

### **Action 3.1: Algorithm Settings Review**
```
Settings Panel Verification:
- ✅ Start Date: 2022-01-01
- ✅ End Date: 2023-12-31  
- ✅ Cash: $100,000
- ✅ Benchmark: SPY (should auto-select)
- ✅ Resolution: Daily
- ✅ Market: US Equity Markets

Any deviations: Correct immediately before proceeding
```

### **Action 3.2: Code Logic Verification**
```
Quick Manual Review:
- ✅ Fast MA = 5 periods
- ✅ Slow MA = 35 periods  
- ✅ Separation threshold = 0.5%
- ✅ Risk management (15% stop loss, 25% take profit)
- ✅ Transaction costs included (0.1%)
- ✅ Debug logging active for monitoring

Expected: All parameters match optimization results
```

### **Action 3.3: Pre-Backtest Checklist**
```
Before Running Backtest:
- ✅ Algorithm compiles without errors
- ✅ All parameters optimized and verified
- ✅ Date range matches local testing (2022-2023)
- ✅ Capital matches expectation ($100K)

## 🚨 ESCALATION PROCEDURES

### **Immediate Escalation Triggers**
1. **Account Issues:** Cannot create account or access Algorithm Lab
2. **Code Issues:** Compilation fails or errors persist  
3. **Platform Issues:** QuantConnect downtime or functionality problems
4. **Parameter Issues:** Optimized settings cannot be replicated

### **Escalation Actions**
```
If Any Issues Occur:
1. DOCUMENT: Screenshot error messages and details
2. TIMESTAMP: Record exact time and duration of issue  
3. ATTEMPT: Try standard troubleshooting (reload, recompile, etc.)
4. ESCALATE: If not resolved in 15 minutes, escalate immediately
5. CONTINUE: Move to Track 2 parallel development while resolving
```

## ⏰ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS - POST COMPLETION

### **Upon Successful Completion (Hour 2)**
```
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. ✅ Begin backtesting validation (Hours 2-6)
2. ✅ Continue Track 2 Colab Pro setup (parallel)
3. ✅ Document exact timestamps and results
4. ✅ Prepare for 12-hour progress report

CRITICAL PATH: Must be complete before Hour 6 paper trading deployment
```

### **Parallel Track 2 Initiation** 
```
WHILE QuantConnect backtest runs:
1. Setup Google Colab Pro subscription
2. Create FinGPT pipeline notebook  
3. Download FinBERT model
4. Test basic sentiment analysis

SUBORDINATE TO TRACK 1: Do not compromise Track 1 focus
