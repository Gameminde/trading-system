   Benchmark: SPY
   Resolution: Daily
   ```

2. **Run Full Backtest:**
   - Click "Backtest" button
   - Monitor for compilation errors
   - Wait for completion (should take 2-3 minutes)

3. **Validate Expected Results:**
   ```
   Expected Metrics (Â±5% tolerance):
   - Total Return: ~24.07%
   - Sharpe Ratio: ~0.801
   - Max Drawdown: ~10.34%
   - Number of Trades: 2-4
   - Alpha vs SPY: ~+21.42%
   ```

4. **Review Trade Log:**
   - Verify signal generation timing
   - Check position sizes and execution
   - Validate risk management triggers

### **STEP 4: PAPER TRADING DEPLOYMENT** (30 minutes)

1. **Deploy to Paper Trading:**
   - Click "Deploy Live" button  
   - Select "Paper Trading" 
   - Confirm $100K virtual capital
   - Set algorithm to "Active"

2. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check algorithm status: "Running"
   - Verify data feed connection
   - Monitor for any runtime errors
   - Confirm order routing is active

3. **Initial Position Monitoring:**
   - Wait for first market open
   - Monitor signal generation
   - Verify position sizing calculations
   - Check stop-loss and take-profit orders

### **STEP 5: MONITORING SETUP** (30 minutes)

1. **Performance Dashboard:**
   - Setup custom charts for key metrics
   - Configure Sharpe ratio tracking
   - Monitor drawdown in real-time
   - Track trade execution quality

2. **Alert Configuration:**
   ```python
   Alert Thresholds:
   - Max Drawdown > 12% (above backtested 10.34%)  
   - Daily Loss > 5%
   - No trades for > 45 days
   - Execution errors or data feed issues
   ```

3. **Reporting Setup:**
   - Daily performance summary
   - Weekly comparison to backtesting
   - Monthly strategy health report
   - Real-time vs expected metrics tracking

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue 1: Compilation Errors**
- Check Python syntax and indentation
- Verify all imports are standard QuantConnect libraries
- Remove any custom dependencies not supported

**Issue 2: Backtest Results Don't Match**
- Verify data resolution (Daily) matches local testing
- Check timezone and market hours alignment  
- Confirm transaction costs and slippage settings

**Issue 3: Paper Trading Won't Deploy**
- Ensure backtest completed successfully first
- Check account verification status
- Verify algorithm has proper error handling

**Issue 4: No Signals Generated**
- Check MA calculation period requirements (35 days minimum)
- Verify separation threshold logic (0.5%)
- Monitor market volatility - low volatility periods may have fewer signals
